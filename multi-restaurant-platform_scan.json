Introduction to the Multi-Restaurant Platform**\\n\\nThe \"Multi-Restaurant Platform\" is a comprehensive, Docker-containerized Spring Boot application designed to serve as a complete solution for restaurant management, online ordering, and delivery services. Its core capability is to support multiple distinct restaurants on a single platform, each with its own configurable menus, dedicated administrators, and operational settings.\\n\\n**Key Features:**\\n* **Multi-restaurant Support:** Enables onboarding and management of numerous restaurants.\\n* **User Authentication & Authorization:** Secure, role-based access control (Roles: ADMIN, RESTAURANT_ADMIN, CUSTOMER) using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).\\n* **Menu Management:** Allows restaurants to create, customize, and manage their menus, including categories and individual food/beverage items.\\n* **Order Processing System:** Facilitates handling of customer orders through various statuses from placement to delivery/completion.\\n* **Payment Integration:** Designed for payment processing, initially with a mock Stripe implementation, with plans for full Stripe integration.\\n* **WebSocket Printing System:** Enables automated, real-time printing of receipts and kitchen tickets directly from the browser.\\n* **Content Management System (CMS):** Includes a built-in CMS for managing platform-wide content.\\n* **Admin Dashboard:** Provides comprehensive tools for platform administrators to configure and manage the system.\\n\\n**Technology Stack:**\\n* **Programming Language:** Java 21\\n* **Framework:** Spring Boot 3.x (The project aims to use recent versions like 3.2.5 or higher, potentially up to 3.4.x as mentioned in project documentation)\\n* **Security:** Spring Security, JWT\\n* **Data Persistence:** Spring Data JPA\\n* **Database:** PostgreSQL (for production environments), H2 (for development and testing)\\n* **Database Migration:** Flyway\\n* **Real-time Communication:** WebSockets\\n* **Build Tool:** Gradle\\n* **Containerization:** Docker\\n* **Utilities:** Lombok\\n\\n**2.
